This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Key Features:
- Utilizes a text dataset for sentiment analysis.
- Implements various CNN architectures with different filter numbers and sizes.
- Reports the results in a detailed PDF document.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset, which contains labeled tweets for sentiment analysis(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis).

## CNN Architectures:
Different CNN architectures have been experimented with varying filter numbers and sizes to find the best model for sentiment analysis.

## Results:
The results of the sentiment analysis experiments are summarized and presented in a PDF report.
